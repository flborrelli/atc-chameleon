			<h2>Why panther?</h2>
			<p>That name is given for this lizard because of peculiar markings on its body which looks like the stripes of a leopard. 
					Since black leopards are called panthers and the chameleon lives in Africa and has black markings, it naturally became the Panther Chameleon.<br><br>
					Also, their color changes have diversified meanings, with color yellow showing anger or aggression, cyan/blue indicating the individuals wish to impress another. 
					Green color signifies a calm and relaxed attitude, and lighter colors signal its intention to mate. 
				A gravid female (carrying eggs) is reluctant to mate would turn itself brown or black with stripes of orange.</p>
